A loyalty platform using blockchain technology is a system that leverages the features of blockchain, such as decentralization, transparency, security, and immutability, to create and manage loyalty programs for customers. Loyalty programs are schemes that reward customers for their repeated purchases or interactions with a brand or a business.

Some of the benefits of using blockchain technology for loyalty platforms are:

- **Efficiency**: Blockchain can reduce the time and cost of issuing, redeeming, and reconciling loyalty points or tokens. Blockchain can also automate tasks such as verification, validation, and settlement of transactions using smart contracts.
- **Quality**: Blockchain can ensure that the loyalty points or tokens are consistent, accurate, engaging, and optimized for the customers and the goals. Blockchain can also use metadata, taxonomies, and tags to enrich and categorize the loyalty points or tokens and make them easily searchable and findable.
- **Creativity**: Blockchain can enable customers to exchange, transfer, or combine their loyalty points or tokens across different brands or businesses. Blockchain can also offer customers more options and features to customize and enhance their loyalty rewards.
- **Flexibility**: Blockchain can support any type and amount of loyalty points or tokens for any industry or purpose. Blockchain can also scale up or down the storage and performance needs according to the demand. Blockchain is compatible with various formats and standards of loyalty points or tokens.

Some of the examples of loyalty platforms using blockchain technology are:

- **Loyyal**: This is a blockchain-as-a-service platform that provides the blockchain architecture for loyalty programs to run their programs better. In cases such as large airlines, who have hundreds of partners, the process of earning, redeeming, and reconciling mileage points can be incredibly complex. Loyyal simplifies this process by using blockchain to create a universal ledger that tracks and validates transactions across different partners¹.
- **American Express**: This is a financial services company that developed a blockchain solution in-house using Hyperledger Fabric. Rather than recording personal information, such as card details, on the blockchain, data is tokenized. When a customer purchases something, the blockchain stores the associated transaction details, which can then be used as triggers for a smart contract. The smart contract then automatically issues rewards points to the customer's account².
- **Tada**: This is a cloud-based loyalty platform that uses blockchain to create a network of merchants and customers. Customers can earn loyalty tokens from any participating merchant and redeem them for rewards from any other merchant in the network. Tada also offers features such as gamification, social sharing, referral programs, and analytics³.
